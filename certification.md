# Certification

## Pre-Certification

1. Email partnersuccess@mews.com to request a Client token and testing property be created in the Mews [Test Environment](mews-api.md#test-environment).
2. Create the following HTTPS endpoint URLs for the Mews [Test Environment](mews-api.md#test-environment)
    * [Update Availability](channel-manager-api.md#update-availability) 
    * [Update Prices](channel-manager-api.md#update-prices)
    * [Update Restrictions](channel-manager-api.md#update-restrictions)
    * [Confirm Booking](channel-manager-api.md#confirm-booking) 
    * [Change Notification](channel-manager-api.md#change-notification) \(optional\)
3. Email the endpoints to partnersuccess@mews.com.
4. Use your test property username and [Get Properties](mews-api.md#get-properties) call to receive the `connectionToken` for the [Test Hotel](mews-api.md#test-environment).
5. Pull hotel information, space mapping, and rate mapping information using the [Get Configuration](mews-api.md#get-configuration) call.
6. Map the all rate plan and space category combinations in the UI of the channel manager backend using the data received in the [Get Configuration](mews-api.md#get-configuration) call.
7. Manually map products from the test hotel in the channel manager backend using the mapping codes received from marketplace@mewssystems.com. \(optional\)

**Note:** Multi-property Mews customers (vacation rentals, apartments, villas, etc.) are often set up in Mews as spaces of one Mews property.  E.g. Property is the Mews Enterprise and Spaces are the rental properties.  These spaces (properties) can be sent to the channel manager as multiple connections, 1 connection token per space (property), or as a single connection for the entire property manager.

## Certification Tests

These tests will be done during a 90-minute call with the Mews Marketplace team and the channel manager.

### Error Tests

All error messages from the channel manager to Mews must use the error codes listed in the Channel Manager API documentation in the [plain reponse](general-remarks.md#plain-response) section and clearly state in the error `message` what the issue is. Ideally, advice on how to solve the error will also be included as these messages are forwarded to the property via email.

| Test | Requirement | Scenario | Expected Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **System errors** | Required |  | A list of the error response `codes` and `messages` for all potential system errors, including timeout errors, maintenance errors, and general downtime errors. | These must comply with the [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unknown reservation error** | Required | Mews will push an invalid reservation and send a confirmation to the channel manager. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 2, "message": "Reservation {mewsConfirmationNumber} is not recorded in the channel manager." }}```. | These must comply with the [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unmapped Space code error** | Required | An availability push with an unmapped Space type code is sent from the test hotel to the [Update Availability](channel-manager-api.md#update-availability) endpoint. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 4, "message": "e.g. Unknown space type mapping code 'ABC'." }}``` as per [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response). | The response must have the unmapped Space code and comply with the [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unmapped Rate code error** | Required | A rate push with an unmapped Rate plan code is sent from the test hotel to the [Update Prices](channel-manager-api.md#update-prices) endpoint. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 5, "message": "e.g. Unknown rate type mapping code 'ABC'." }}``` as per [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) | The response must have the unmapped Rate code and comply with the [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Connection inactive or not set up error** | Required | The channel manager connection is deactivated from the channel manager extranet and then an full inventory push is sent from the test hotel to the channel manager's endpoints. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 3, "message": "e.g. The connection is missing or inactive." }}``` | These must comply with the [plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) requirements including the correct error `code`, either 3 or 8, and a clear error `message`. |
| **API errors** | Required | The channel manager sends an invalid format reservation. | Mews returns an API error, which explains why the reservation cannot be created in Mews. | The channel manager logs the error and does not re-push the invalid reservation. If possible, the channel manager fixes the error on its own and re-pushes the reservation.

## Evaluation

* If the required tests cannot be completed, Mews will not allow the channel manager to advance to the production environment.
  * Once issues are resolved, certification will start over.
* If there are no critical issues discovered during certification, the channel manager will be advanced to the production environment.
  * Mews will require unique https production endpoint URLs for the [Channel Manager API](certification.md#channel-manager-api).
  * Mews will issue a new Client token for the channel manager to use in the live environment.
  * The channel manager will issue documenation of their setup process for approval.
