> ### Terminology
> We use the term *Property* to describe the hotel, hostel or other enterprise; we use the term *Space* to refer to a hotel room, dormitory bed or other type of bookable space, and *Space Type* to refer to the category of *Space* offered by the *Property*. Although typically a room in a hotel, this could be for example a squash court in a sports facility.
> For a full description of all the terms used in the API, see the [Mews Glossary for Open API users](https://help.mews.com/s/article/Mews-Glossary-for-Open-API-users?language=en_US).
