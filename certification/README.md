# Certification

Here you can find information about the certification process for new partners using the __Mews Channel Manager API__, including the list of standard tests.

## Pre-Certification

The process is as follows:

1. Email partnersuccess@mews.com to request a `Client Token` and for a test property to be created in the Mews [Test Environment](../mews-operations/README.md#test-environment).
2. Create the following HTTPS endpoint URLs on the Channel Manager side [Test Environment](../channel-manager-operations/README.md#environments)
    * [Update Availability](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-availability) 
    * [Update Prices](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-prices)
    * [Update Restrictions](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-restrictions)
    * [Confirm Booking](../channel-manager-operations/reservations.md#confirm-booking) 
    * [Change Notification](../channel-manager-operations/notifications.md#change-notification) \(optional\)
3. Email the endpoint details to partnersuccess@mews.com.
4. Use your test property username and [Get Properties](../mews-operations/configuration.md#get-properties) API operation to fetch the `connectionToken` for the [Test Property](../mews-operations/README.md#test-environment).
5. Pull property information, space type mapping and rate mapping information using the [Get Configuration](../mews-operations/configuration.md#get-configuration) API operation.
6. Map all the rate plan and space category combinations in the user interface of the channel manager system using the data received from the [Get Configuration](../mews-operations/configuration.md#get-configuration) request.

> Note: Multi-property enterprises (vacation rentals, apartments, villas, etc.) are often set up in Mews as spaces belonging to a single Mews property
> i.e. the 'property' is the Mews enterprise customer and the 'spaces' are the individual rental properties.
> These spaces (i.e. properties) can be sent to the channel manager as multiple connections, with one `Connection Token` per space (i.e. property), or as a single connection for the entire enterprise.

## Certification Tests

These tests will be conducted during a 90-minute call between the Mews Marketplace team and a representative of the channel manager.  

### Inventory Push Tests

| **Receive a full inventory push from Mews** | Required | The connection is enabled and Mews sends the maximum update to the [Update Availability](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-availability), [Update Prices](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-prices) and [Update Restrictions](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-restrictions) endpoints. A minimum full inventory push is 365 days. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": true}``` and data is updated in the channel manager extranet. | Being able to accept this data is required but push size or frequency can be decreased if necessary. |

### Error Tests

All error messages from the channel manager to Mews must use the error codes listed in the Channel Manager API documentation in the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) section and clearly state in the error `message` what the issue is. Ideally, advice on how to solve the error will also be included as these messages are forwarded to the property via email.

| Test | Requirement | Scenario | Expected Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **System errors** | Required |  | A list of the error response `codes` and `messages` for all potential system errors, including timeout errors, maintenance errors, and general downtime errors. | These must comply with the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unknown reservation error** | Required | Mews will push an invalid reservation and send a confirmation to the channel manager. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 2, "message": "Reservation {mewsConfirmationNumber} is not recorded in the channel manager." }}```. | These must comply with the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unmapped Space code error** | Required | An availability push with an unmapped Space type code is sent from the test hotel to the [Update Availability](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-availability) endpoint. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 4, "message": "e.g. Unknown space type mapping code 'ABC'." }}``` as per [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response). | The response must have the unmapped Space code and comply with the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Unmapped Rate code error** | Required | A rate push with an unmapped Rate plan code is sent from the test hotel to the [Update Prices](../channel-manager-operations/inventory.md#update-prices) endpoint. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 5, "message": "e.g. Unknown rate type mapping code 'ABC'." }}``` as per [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#simple-response) | The response must have the unmapped Rate code and comply with the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) requirements including the correct error `code` and a clear error `message`. |
| **Connection inactive or not set up error** | Required | The channel manager connection is deactivated from the channel manager extranet and then an full inventory push is sent from the test hotel to the channel manager's endpoints. | The channel manager returns ```{ "success": false, "error": { "code": 3, "message": "e.g. The connection is missing or inactive." }}``` | These must comply with the [synchronous simple response](../guidelines/responses.md#synchronous-simple-response) requirements including the correct error `code`, either 3 or 8, and a clear error `message`. |
| **API errors** | Required | The channel manager sends an invalid format reservation. | Mews returns an API error, which explains why the reservation cannot be created in Mews. | The channel manager logs the error and does not re-push the invalid reservation. If possible, the channel manager fixes the error on its own and re-pushes the reservation.

## Evaluation

If the required tests cannot be completed successfully, Mews will not allow the channel manager to advance to the production environment.
Once any issues are resolved, certification will start over.

If there are no critical issues discovered during certification, the channel manager will be advanced to the production environment.
  * Mews will require unique HTTPS production endpoint URLs for the Channel Manager side
  * Mews will issue a new `Client Token` for the channel manager to use in the live environment
  * The channel manager will issue documentation of their set-up process for approval
