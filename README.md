# Mews Channel Manager API

Welcome to the __Mews Channel Manager API__. This is the Mews API for distribution and sales channels, supporting two main use cases: distributing availability, rates and inventory data to sales channels, and accepting reservations from sales channels.
To fully implement the API, you need to both make requests to Mews and also create your own endpoints to accept data from Mews.

> ### Two-way functionality
> * The [Mews side](mews-operations/README.md) handles requests from Channel Managers, including new reservations.
> * The [Channel Manager side](channel-manager-operations/README.md) handles requests from Mews, including availability updates.

For detailed information on connecting, authentication tokens, error codes, and more, see our [Usage guidelines](guidelines/README.md).
To gain deeper insights into Mews concepts, see [Concepts](concepts/README.md). For specific scenarios, see [Use cases](use-cases/README.md).
