## Environments

### Test Environment

This environment is meant to be used during implementation of the client applications.

* **Platform Address** - `https://demo.mews.li`
* **Client Token** - will be provided to you by Mews upon request.
* **Connection Token** - will be provided to you by Mews upon request.
* **Reservation Push Endpoint** - unique to the environment and list under [Process Group](mews-api.md#process-group)

The property is based in Czech Republic, it accepts `CZK`, `EUR` and `GBP` currencies \(any of them may be used\).

To sign into the system, use the following credentials:

* **Sign in URL** - `https://demo.mews.li`
* **Email** - `chm-api@mews.li`
* **Password** - `chm-api`

#### Test Credit Cards

The property is configured to accept following test credit cards:

* **Accepted Test Credit Cards:**

## Operations

### Get Properties

\[`sync`\] This method is used to obtain properties based on the `email` of an employee of the Mews enterprise (hotel, hostel or apartment group). It is required that the `email` is verified to belong to an employee on whose behalf the API call is made. Response returns list of all enterprises, where employee has access in Mews.

#### Request `[PlatformAddress]/api/channelManager/v1/getProperties`

```javascript
{
  "clientToken": "[Channel manager client token]",
  "email": "chm-api@mews.li"
}
```

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clientToken` | `string` | required | Client token of the channel manager. |
| `email` | `string` | required | Verified email of a Mews employee. |

#### Response

This sample response shows that there are 2 properties where the employee with provided email works. First _Sample Hotel_ property has 3 named connections with the channel manager, second _White House Hotel_ has no connection yet.

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "properties": [
    {
      "id": "sample-hostel",
      "name": "Sample Hostel",
      "connections": [
        {

        },
        {
          "token": "[3rd connectionToken]"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "whh",
      "name": "White House Hotel"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `properties` | [`Property Info`](mews-api.md#property-info) collection | required | List of all properties to connect. |

#### Property Info

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | required | Name of the property. |
| `id` | `string` | required | Unique id of the property. |
| `connections` | [`Connection Info`](mews-api.md#connection-info) collection | optional | List of all existing connections. |

### Get Configuration

Returns configuration of the enterprise and the client.

#### Request `[PlatformAddress]/api/channelManager/v1/getConfiguration`

\[`sync`\] Returns configuration of a concrete connection

```javascript
{
  "clientToken": "[Channel manager client token]",
  "connectionToken": "[Token of a concrete connection]",
  "extent": {
    "includeUnsynchronizedRates": true
  }
}
```

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clientToken` | `string` | required | Client token of the channel manager. |
| `connectionToken` | `string` | required | Token of a concrete connection. |
| `extent` | [`Configuration extent`](mews-api.md#configuration-extent) object | optional | Allows to specify certain data to be included in the response. |

#### Configuration Extent

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `includeUnsynchronizedRates` | `bool` | optional | If `true`, unsynchronized [`Rate plan`](mews-api.md#rate-plan)s will be returned as well. Unsynchronized rate plan means that Mews will not push prices for that rate plan, but when a reservation comes with the rate plan code, Mews will link the correct rate plan with the reservation. |

#### Response

This is example of a _successful_ response. In case an 
occurred, the response will contain only [`Error`](general-remarks.md#error) object with details.

```javascript
{
  "clientToken": "[Channel manager client token]",

### Request ARI update

\[`async`\] This method allows channel manager to request an ARI data update for certain space types and rate plans in addition to the changes automatically sent in the next Delta update. The requested data will be sent by Mews asynchronously via push operations of channel manager API.

#### Request `[PlatformAddress]/api/channelManager/v1/requestAriUpdate`

```javascript
{
  "clientToken": "[Channel manager client token]",
  "connectionToken": "[Token of a concrete connection]",
  "from": "2018-01-01",
  "to": "2018-02-01",
  "ariType": [
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "spaceTypeCodes": [
    "KD",
    "QD"
  ],
  "ratePlanCodes": [
    "FF"
  ]
}
```

| Property | Type |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `clientToken` | `string` | required | Client token of the channel manager. |
| `connectionToken` | `string` | required | Token of a concrete connection. |
| `from` | `string` | required | Start of requested update in format `"yyyy-MM-dd"`. |
| `to` | `string` | required | End of requested update in format `"yyyy-MM-dd"` \(included\). |
| `ariType` | `int` collection | optional | [`ARI Types`](mews-api.md#ari-types)~~ to be updated. _Blank means all, empty _~~`[]`~~_ means none._~~ _Currently not supported, always updates all._ |

| `ratePlanCodes` | `string` collection | optional | ~~Rate plans to be updated. _Blank means all, empty _~~`[]`~~_ means none._~~ _Currently not supported, always updates all._. |

#### ARI Types

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | Availability |
| `2` | Prices |
| `3` | Restrictions |

#### Response

[Plain response](general-remarks.md#plain-response) will determine whether the ARI update was accepted for processing or not.

### Process Group

\[`async`\] This operation allows the channel manager to push a reservation group \(i.e. _booking_\) to Mews. This option allows creations, modifications and \(partial\) cancellations. Mews will process and confirm the booking asynchronously.

#### Request 

* **Demo Environment:** `https://sandbox.pci-proxy.com/v1/push/0426f19b66715a93`
* **Production Environment:** `https://api.pci-proxy.com/v1/push/b2721c9a0351d553`

The example shows a valid group definition with 2 space reservations + cancellation of the 3rd space reservation. First `reservation` definition shows all details, second `reservation` definition shows the minimal required details for creation / modification of a `reservation`. The 3rd `reservation` definition shows the partial cancellation - cancelling the 3rd space reservation.

There are certain rules that need to be followed in order for Mews to process the group correctly:

* It is required to send multiple related reservations in one group as part of one message.
  * The whole group is uniquely identified by `channelManagerId` in Mews and in the channel manager extranet.
  * Each reservation should have a unique code within the group. The same code for the reservation should be provided in any following modification message.
  * Each reservation in the group can have different `start`, `end`, `spaceTypeCode`, `ratePlanCode`.
* Group total cost `group`.`totalCost` is the sum of each `reservation`.`totalCost`, which is the sum of all night costs and total costs of all `extras` of the `reservation`.
  * All costs in the message are inclusive of VAT.
  * If for any reason the `group`.`totalCost` is be different, Mews will automatically distribute the missing/additional cost to the nights, so the `group`.`totalCost` is achieved.
* When **modifying** some reservations from a multi-reservation group, the whole group definition with all other unchanged reservations needs to be sent \(i.e. Mews doesn't process diffs\).
* When **cancelling** a reservation from a multi-reservation group, all remaining reservations need to be present in the group definition as well.
  * There are 2 ways to cancel a reservation from a multi-reservation group.
    * A. If the `reservation`.`state` is set to [Reservation States](mews-api.md#reservation-states).`Cancelled`.
    * B. If the reservation is not included in the group definiton message.
* When **cancelling** a whole group, the `reservations` collection can be empty of all reservations provided as cancelled \(as per case A above\).
